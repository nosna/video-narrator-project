00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:07,500
The crisp air of autumn settled over the yard, bringing with it falling leaves and a quiet calm.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,700
A golden carpet gathered at the foot of the old tree, rustling secrets in the breeze.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:23,500
Suddenly, a little head poked through the pile... it was Pip, the hedgehog, ready for adventure!

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,900
He scampered out, his nose twitching, searching for something special in the grass.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:45,900
Up the sturdy trunk he went, climbing high to get a better view, a hopeful smile on his face.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,500
And there, nestled amongst the leaves below, was little Nutmeg, the acorn, who had taken a tumble.

7
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,800
Pip saw his friend and hurried back down.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,500
He found Nutmeg looking a little bruised from the fall.

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:15,500
Pip leaned in, gently nudging his friend.

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,500
A little bandage helped make everything better.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Together, they found warmth and comfort in the soft pile of leaves, two friends ready for whatever autumn brought.

12
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:48,900
Meanwhile, deep in the woods, Barnaby the badger was settling in for a cozy night by the fire.
