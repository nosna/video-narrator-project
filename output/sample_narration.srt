1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,300
Autumn arrives...

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:13,300
...and the leaves begin to fall, gathering in soft piles on the ground.

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:20,000
Out from the rustling depths, a small creature stirred.

4
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:25,300
A little hedgehog, venturing out into the crisp air.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,600
He looked around, a gentle smile on his face, ready for adventure.

6
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:40,000
High above, he climbed the sturdy branches of the old tree.

7
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,600
From his perch, he surveyed the world below.

8
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,800
And there, nestled amongst the scattered leaves, he saw something...

9
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,500
...something small, and perhaps, a little lost.

10
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,200
He carefully descended, drawn to the tiny figure.

11
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:10,600
An acorn! But this little acorn had a small boo-boo.

12
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:18,400
A bandage, carefully placed, a sign of a recent tumble.

13
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:26,200
Finding comfort in each other's company, the hedgehog and the acorn settled in, friends found in the autumn leaves.

14
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:35,500
Meanwhile, in the heart of the woods...

15
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:46,500
...a solitary badger made camp, the fire casting a warm glow against the gathering dusk.
